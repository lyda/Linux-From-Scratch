<title>Making the LFS system bootable</title>

<para>Your shiny new LFS system is almost complete. One of the last things to
do is ensure you can boot it. The instructions below apply only to
Colbalt RaQ2/Cube2 servers. Information on <quote>boot
loading</quote> for other architectures should be available in the usual
resource-specific locations for those architectures.</para>

<para>Boot loading can be a complex area. First, a few cautionary words. You
really should be familiar with your current boot loader and any other
operating systems present on your hard drive(s) that you might wish to keep
bootable. Please make sure that you have an emergency boot disk ready, so that
you can rescue your computer if, by any chance, your computer becomes unusable
(un-bootable).</para>

<para>Earlier, we compiled and installed the Cobalt boot loader software in
preparation for this step. Now we will configure our system to boot using 
Colo. Here is a simpe default.colo to use.</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /boot/default.colo &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal>#:CoLo:#
#
# load linux
#
lcd 'Booting &linux-raq2-version;...'
load vmlinux-&linux-raq2-version;.gz
execute root=/dev/hda2 console=ttyS0,115200 ide1=noprobe</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

<para>Included in /usr/lib/colo/examples are more examples of a
default.colo file.</para>

<para>The FHS stipulates that Bootloader's configuration file should be symlinked to
/etc/{Bootloader Name}.  To satisfy this requirement for colo, issue the
following command:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir /etc/colo &amp;&amp;
ln -s /boot/colo/default.colo /etc/colo</userinput></screen>
