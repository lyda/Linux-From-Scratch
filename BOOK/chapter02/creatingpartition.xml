<title>Creating a New Partition</title>

<para>In order to build a new Linux system, space is required -- an
empty disk partition. If the computer does not have a free partition
or room on any of the hard disks to make one, LFS can be built on the
same partition where the current distribution is installed.</para>

<note><para>This procedure is not recommended for your first LFS
install, but if you are short on disk space and feel brave, you can
use the hint at <ulink
url="&hints-root;lfs_next_to_existing_systems.txt"/>.</para></note>

<para>A minimal system requires a partition of around 1.3 gigabytes
(GB).  This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile 
the packages. However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary
Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which
will require additional space (2 or 3 GB). The LFS system itself will
not take up this much space. A large portion of this required amount
of space is to provide sufficient free temporary space. Compiling
packages can require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after
the package is installed.</para>

<para>Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
disk partition as swap space.  This space is used by the kernel to
store seldom-used data to make room in memory for active processes.
The swap partition for an LFS system can be the same as the one used
by the host system, so another swap partition will not need to be
created if your host system already uses one.</para>

<para>Start a disk partitioning program such as
<command>cfdisk</command> or <command>fdisk</command> with a command
line option naming the hard disk on which the new partition will be
created&mdash;for example <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda</filename> for
the primary Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) disk. Create a Linux native
partition and a swap partition, if needed. Please refer to the man
pages of <command>cfdisk</command> or <command>fdisk</command> if you
do not yet know how to use the programs.</para>

<para>Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g.,
<filename class="devicefile">hda5</filename>). This book will refer to this as the LFS
partition. Also remember the designation of the swap partition. These
names will be needed later for the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
file.</para>
