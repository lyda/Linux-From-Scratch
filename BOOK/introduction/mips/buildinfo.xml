  <title>Recommendend Build Information</title>

  <para>On the RaQ2, we are recommending the following:</para>

  <blockquote>

    <para>The RaQ2 uses DOS style partitions, so build on a x86 and
    put the RaQ2 hard drive into that system.</para>

    <para>Follow the directions using the reboot section.</para>

    <para>Remove the hard drive and put it into the RaQ2 and
    continue your build.</para>

  </blockquote>

  <para>On other MIPS based systems, you will have to build on the
  machine itself, since most of the other MIPS machines use SGI
  style partitions.</para>
